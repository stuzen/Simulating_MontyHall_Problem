    "##                     Monty Hall Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was originally posed and solved in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975. It became famous as a question from a reader's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's \"Ask Marilyn\" column in Parade magazine in 1990:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"
